1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,175
We will start off our BBQ tour in Austin.

2
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:06,501
Iron Works, then to Rudys, then to Lamberts.

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:9,001
We will then take 183 South to Lockhart.

4
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:14,501
And visit Smittys, Kreuz Market, 
and Blacks Smokehouse.

5
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:19,501
And I assume we'll start the day at Franklin BBQ.

6
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:24,001
My Leader...

7
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:26,901
It...

8
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:31,901
It is too late to go to Franklins.

9
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:33,901
It is already past 10:30 AM.

10
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:52,901
Anyone who has not been to Franklins.

11
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:56,001
Please,
Leave the room.

12
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:11,001
30 minutes before they open!

13
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:14,001
Too late! 30 minutes before they open!

14
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:19,501
Who do these pit bosses think they are?

15
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:24,001
Oooo their brisket is so special!

16
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:29,801
We were late last time,
All they had left was cole slaw.

17
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:35,801
All I hear from everyone,
"Oh Franklins is so amazing, you have to go!"

18
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:38,001
Sir, we told you to get there early.

19
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:41,501
Early?  Not a whole entire hour early!

20
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,001
Sir, you said it can't be that good.

21
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:47,501
That was until I saw 150 people in line.

22
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:51,001
Ridiculous!

23
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,501
People camped all night once,
Just to be first in line.

24
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:58,501
Just to get a cheap cut of beef!

25
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:04,501
How are the rest of us
supposed to compete with that?

26
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:07,501
Just to get a decent lunch.

26
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:11,501
I do profess it is simply unfair!

27
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:17,501
These waiting lines are like living under Stalin.

28
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:23,501
They think they are so special.

29
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:30,501
Sure, there are never more 
than 5 people at Bananarchy.
Even during ACL.

30
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:36,001
It just seems like,

31
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:41,001
I'll never get to eat BBQ there.

32
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:48,501
To be forever tormented by everyone asking me,
"Isn't Franklins the BEST?"

33
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:52,501
To which I can only sheepishly respond,

34
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:55,501
"Yes! The cole slaw is amazing!"

35
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:00,501
Gerda, you'll get to go there someday.

36
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:09,501
All I wanted was a quarter lb of moist brisket.

37
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:14,501
A couple of pork ribs would be a nice addition too.

37
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:18,501
A sausage link.

38
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:26,501
Some espresso sauce.

39
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:40,501
Instead I'll be eating BBQ from a gas station.
Or what I dread most,

40
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:48,501
Salt Lick.
